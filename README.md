### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
the process was to first building the html file and then set the customization using css.
i think i messed up with the interactivity of the page and i'm not satisfied with the result.
i couldn't make the pointer with the color that is required.
i used maybe too much flex and i guess it could be a lot simpler.
please check it out and tell me what is wrong, i'll appreciate it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
